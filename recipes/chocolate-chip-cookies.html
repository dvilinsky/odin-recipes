        <h3 class="recipe-subsection">Description</h3>
        <p>My love for chocolate chip cookies goes back to my days making Christmas cookies with my dear mother growing up every
            year. When we first started, we would use that old stalwart recipe, that on the back of the package of Nestle Toll House
            cookies. More often than not, those failed miserably. They were dry, lacking flavor, and while edible fresh out of 
            the oven, they would soon harden into unpalatable pucks, not fit for man or beast.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I began to iterate (I was already a developer at a young age!) in this recipe. I googled furiously. Recipe after 
            recipe after recipe. Some were ok. Some were horrible. Some were even good. But none could quell my cookie cravings. 
            Until I stumbled upon <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/tasty-101-ultimate-brown-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies">
            this recipe</a> from <strong>Tasty</strong>, Buzzfeed's cooking channel. What follows is basically that recipe, with 
            a few tips and tricks that I've learned over the years. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="recipe-subsection">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup bread flour</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (likely more, see below)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup/2 sticks butter (salted or unsalted doesn't really matter, just adjust salt below)</li>
            <li>Splash of water</li>
            <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>Â½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Kosher salt for unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon for salted</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract to your heart's desire</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon espresso</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>8oz good-quality dark chocolate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="recipe-subsection">Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, measure out your sugars. Set aside</li>
            <li>In a pan over a low-medium heat, add your butter. Once it begins to melt, stir <em>constantly.</em> Do this until 
                the foaming subsides. Continue stirring until it turns a dark brown color. Be careful here! Butter turns from "brown"
                to "burnt" very quickly. I've come close to burning it a few times myself! Once the milk solids have turned brown, remove
                from heat and pour into your measuring jug. Add your splash of water until you have two cups of liquid. Careful here! The 
                butter, being hot, will foam up (I've certainly <em>never</em> burnt myself from that, <em>wink wink</em>). Refrigerate the 
                butter until it is still liquid, but barely warm to the touch. This is important -- if the butter is still hot, it will not 
                emulsify with the sugar. 
            </li>
            <li>Once your butter has cooled down, combine with the sugar. Beat on high speed until it becomes light, pale brown. Many
                recipes will say this stage takes only 3-4 minutes. In my experience, that has not been the case. Expect to spend at least 
                10 minutes continuously beating. But take heart! By doing this, we're incorporating air into the dough. This will give you a 
                thick, chewy cookie. 
            </li>
            <li>One at a time, add the egg and the egg yolk. You should whip this until you get an almost mousse-like consistency. Mixture
                should be very pale at this point. In my experience, this should take about 2-3 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>Beat in the espresso powder and vanilla. Don't be afraid to go heavy on the vanilla!</li>
            <li>Add your salt and baking soda</li>
            <li>In thirds, add the flour and bread flour. A few things to note here: 
                <ul>
                    <li>In some baking recipes, especially <em>cake</em> recipes, you may have seen warnings not to 
                    overmix the batter. That is not a concern here. You see, mixing any flour-based dough or batter 
                    creates <em>gluten</em>. Gluten is what gives bread its chewy texture. The more gluten, the chewier 
                    the end result. In cakes or pancakes, where you want a tender crumb, you want to avoid the development
                    of gluten. Here, however, we <em>want</em> a chewy cookie! Unless you really beat the crap out of 
                    it, you won't overmix and develop too much gluten.</li>
                    <li>The recipe calls for 2 cups of flour total. In practice, I have found that I have needed more than that. 
                        What you're really looking for here is the <em>texture</em> of the dough. You want to incorporate enough flour 
                        such that when you pick up some dough between your fingers, it does not stick to fingers; instead, the dough pulls 
                        away and sticks to itself. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Chop up your chocolate into chunks and beat into the dough. No need to get too precise here. In fact, I 
                prefer to have different size chunks, and big ones make for incredible pools of chocolate in the finished product!
            </li>
            <li>Cover and Refrigerate overnight. This step is absolutely <em>crucial</em>. Not only does this develop flavor, 
            it also allows the butter in the dough to harder. This prevents the cookies from spreading too much in the oven, leaving 
            you with a thin, crispy mess, as in <a href="https://img.buzzfeed.com/tasty-app-user-assets-prod-us-east-1/tips/f1a6a195488e481f895fb7e8c288bcdd.jpeg?downsize=800:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto">this</a> image. 
            Don't be like that person.</li>
            <li>The next day, roll your cookies into golf-ball sized balls. The dough will be hard, so you might need to chisel away 
                at it with a butter knife. This is a good sign!
            </li>
            <li>Place your balls into the freezer for <em>at least</em> a half-hour before cooking. While they're big-chilling, pre-heat 
            your oven to 375F.</li>
            <li>Place your balls onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet. I find a thick, heavy cookie sheet works best here, though the 
                disposable aluminium ones are fine in a pinch. Place into the oven for 12 minutes. Watch this coooking time like a hawk! 
                The cookies will go from underdone to just right to overdone in a flash!
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, and slide the parchment sheet off the tray and onto the counter. Let cookies cool (if you can 
                wait!) at least 15 minutes before attempting to remove from the sheet; they are very soft. Allow them to cool for 1-2 hours 
                before attempting to store in an airtight container. 
            </li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining dough. Leave the dough balls in the freezer until they are ready to go in the oven. Don't worry, the 
                ones that go in last are usually the best! Also, be sure not to place them directly on the hot cookie sheet. Run it under cool water, 
                or use a fresh sheet every time. Putting the cookies on a hot sheet will negatively affect the delicate balance we have achieved. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="recipe-subsection">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>And that's it! I know this seems like a lot of steps, and a somewhat finicky recipes. And frankly, it somewhat is. It is 
            remarkable how something as simple as the humble chocolate-chip cookie can require such efforts to create! But trust me, once 
            you sink your teeth into that first gooey, chocolatey bite, all your efforts will be oh-so worth it, and you'll thank yourself 
            that you put in the effort. Thank you for reading, and happy baking!
